# NIFI Monitoring for Splunk

## Overview

Nifi Monitoring is a solution that proposes to solve a great difficulty encountered
during the development of NIFI Projects and that corresponds to the complex process of monitoring the operation of different NIFI instances simultaneously.

This applications solves this problem centralizing all the information regarding the operation of the different components for various instances and has a set of panels that allow you to clearly and quickly view the operation of these instances.

## Requirements

- Splunk version: 8.2 or higher
- NIFI TA Monitoring

And the following complements:

- [Lookup File Editor](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1724/)
- [Status Indicator - Custom Visualization](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3119/)

## Configuration

This application requieres enabling a HTTP Event Collector (HEC) data input to receive the information from NIFI.

The configuraci√≥n of NIFI and Splunk allow to establish two types of sending and receiving information depending if the nifi instances have authentication methods.

- No authentication: This setting will set NIFI as the main road for sending data to Splunk.
- Basic authentication: Splunk will be making requests to the NIFI instances to retrieve the information from the Monitoring API by enabling and using the Data Input NIFI.
