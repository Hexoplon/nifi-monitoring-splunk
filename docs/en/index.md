# Introduction

Nifi Monitoring is a solution proposal that solves a great difficulty that we find today when developing projects in NIFI. The objective of this application is to centralize the information on the operation of the different components for several instances simultaneously and to visualize all the information quickly and clearly through a series of panels and thereby know how the different instances are working.
